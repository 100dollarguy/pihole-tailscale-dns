 # Private DNS Ad-Blocking and Remote Access with Pi-hole + Tailscale

## üëã Why I Built This

I care about online privacy and wanted to block ads and trackers across all my devices ‚Äî not just in browsers. Public DNS providers like Google or Cloudflare are fast, but they often log data. I wanted full control over DNS resolution and to keep it private.

Also, my internet provider (Jio Fiber) uses CGNAT, which means I don't get a public IP address. So remote access was tricky. This project helped me learn how to work around that using Tailscale.

## üîç Problem I Solved

* Block ads and trackers on every device (not just browsers)
* Encrypt and control all DNS queries (no third-party logging)
* Remotely access DNS and admin panel (even behind CGNAT)
* Learn real-world tools like Linux, DNS, VPNs, Docker, and iptables

---

## üß∞ Tools I Used

* macOS (my laptop)
* [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)¬†to run Ubuntu Server on Mac
* Ubuntu Server 22.04 (inside UTM)
* Docker
* Pi-hole (ad-blocking DNS)
* Unbound (recursive DNS resolver)
* Tailscale (zero-config VPN)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How I Built It (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Set Up Ubuntu VM

* Installed UTM on macOS
* Created a VM with Ubuntu Server 22.04
* Gave it 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and 15GB disk

### 2. Update Ubuntu

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
![ubuntu-update](/screenshots/Ubuntu-Update.png)
```
---

### 3. Install Docker

```shell
sudo apt install docker.io -y
```
```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

exit  # Then re-login

### 4. Run Pi-hole in Docker

```shell
sudo docker run -d \
  --name pihole \
  -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -e TZ="Asia/Kolkata" \
  -e WEBPASSWORD="yourpassword" \
  -v $(pwd)/pihole/etc-pihole:/etc/pihole \
  -v $(pwd)/pihole/etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d \
  --dns=127.0.0.1 --dns=1.1.1.1 \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  pihole/pihole:latest

```

### 5. Add Unbound for Private DNS

```shell
sudo apt install unbound -y
```

```shell
curl -o /var/lib/unbound/root.hints https://www.internic.net/domain/named.cache
```

Create config:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf
```
```shell
Restart Unbound:
```
```shell
sudo systemctl enable unbound
```

```shell
sudo systemctl restart unbound
```

### 6. Install Tailscale

```shell
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```


```shell
sudo tailscale up --advertise-tags=tag:pihole --accept-dns=false
```

### 7. Firewall Setup for DNS Access via Tailscale
```shell
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 100.0.0.0/8 -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
```
```shell
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 100.0.0.0/8 -p tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
```

(Optional: Block others)

```shell
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j DROP
```
```shell
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 53 -j DROP
```

### 8. Set Global DNS in Tailscale (No Need to Configure Each Device)

Instead of changing DNS settings manually on every device, I used Tailscale‚Äôs admin panel:

1. Went to¬†[https://login.tailscale.com](https://login.tailscale.com/)
2. Opened the¬†**DNS**¬†section
3. Added Pi-hole‚Äôs Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x) as¬†**Global Nameserver**
4. Saved and synced settings

Now every Tailscale-connected device automatically uses Pi-hole for DNS. Super easy.

### 9. Test on Remote Device

```shell
nslookup doubleclick.net 100.x.x.x
```

Should return:

```shell
Name: doubleclick.net
Address: 0.0.0.0
```

## üîÑ How It Works

1. Remote devices connect to Pi-hole using Tailscale
2. Pi-hole blocks ads and trackers
3. Other queries go to Unbound for secure, recursive resolution
4. Everything stays encrypted, private, and works even behind CGNAT


üìù Note: The connection from Unbound to the root DNS servers is not encrypted (DNS still uses port 53).
But the traffic from your device to Pi-hole (and Unbound) is fully encrypted through Tailscale, so your ISP or others can‚Äôt see or log your DNS activity.
Later, you can add DNS-over-HTTPS for full end-to-end encryption.

## ü§Ø What I Learned

* Recursive DNS vs Forwarded DNS
* How Docker volumes and ports work
* What CGNAT is and how Tailscale helps bypass it
* How firewall rules and DNS resolution interact

---

## üò§ Challenges I Faced

* Unbound wouldn‚Äôt start until I added the¬†`root.hints`¬†file manually
* DNS wasn‚Äôt working remotely until I fixed firewall + Tailscale DNS override
* Learned Docker‚Äôs port forwarding the hard way üòÖ

---

## üöÄ What I Plan to Improve

* Use¬†`docker-compose`¬†for easier management
* Add DNS-over-HTTPS fallback option
* Run it on Raspberry Pi or always-on server
* Add login + 2FA for remote admin
